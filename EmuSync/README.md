# emu-coop

This directory contains some Lua scripts that, when loaded by a compliant emulator such as snes9x-rr/snes9x-coop, can synchronize emulator state over the internet (allowing "cooperative" playthroughs of single-player games).

Each game you want to use this with requires a "mode" file in the modes/ directory. Currently included are modes for Link to the Past (JPv1.0) and the Link to the Past Randomizer.\
The files you see here are very likely not compatible with other forks of emu-coop. It is recommended to always exchange the entire coop-folder for every release/fork.\
**WARNING: Modes are PROGRAMS, like a .exe file. Do not install a mode file unless it came from someone you know and trust.**

You can reach me, FirenX, here at GitHub or at Discord as Feed4Fame#7342.

## What is shared?

All modes share:
* The complete Inventory (all Y-items, all ability items, swords, shields, mails)
* Bottle Contents
* Arrows, Bombs, Rupees
* Heart Containers/Pieces
* Half Magic Buff
* Curent HP/Magic (optional)
* Triforce Pieces (in Rando)

On top of that, Link to the Past and Link to the Past Randomizer - Identical Seeds share:
* Pendants/Crystals
* Compasses, Maps
* Keys (Big and Small)
* Overworld/Dungeon data (e.g. Doors/Chests/Item Locations are opened/taken for both players if one player does so)
* Boss kills (including Aga1 and Aga2)
* Reaching the Triforce Room

For the Overworld/Dungeon data to share correctly it is recommended to not be in the same overworld screen/dungeon superroom simultaneously.

For Link to the Past Randomizer - Different Seeds it is recommended to play on a higher difficulty setting or with customizer seeds since you will otherwise end up at 20 Hearts, Golden Sword, Red Mail, Mirrorshield, Quarter Magic relatively quickly.


## How to Use

* Open the ROM using the snes9x-coop
* Have both players open the coop.lua using "File -> Lua Scripting -> New Lua Script Window..."
* If asked what mode to use, pick the one you intend to use
* Fill out the connection setting, pick your options and click "OK". Only use "Retro mode" if you are playing a Retro Variation seed of the Randomizer
* Wait for the script to say "Connected to Partner"
* You can now play the game

In case something terrible happens and you need to restart/reconnect:
* Save&Quit
* Close and restart the emulator
* Open the ROM you were using
* Open your save file starting the game
* Start the coop.lua as described above. This time use different nicks and pick the option "Restarting after a Crash?"
* The script will now take its time to sync both players again. Wait until it says "Syncing is done"
* You can now keep on playing
